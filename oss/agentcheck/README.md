# agentcheck

Produce an evidence pack for an agent deployment. Zero dependencies, Node 18+,
everything it executes is read-only.

```sh
curl -O https://hellouchit.com/oss/agentcheck/agentcheck.mjs
node agentcheck.mjs init
# fill in agentcheck.config.json
node agentcheck.mjs check --md evidence.md
```

## What it refuses to do

Most agent-governance tooling produces a score out of ten and a green tick. That
number is worse than nothing, because almost every control here can only be
attested by a human, and a tool that quietly turns an attestation into a
measurement launders an opinion into evidence.

So `agentcheck` separates two things and never merges them:

| | meaning |
|---|---|
| **DECLARED** | a human asserted it and signed their name to the assertion |
| **VERIFIED** | a read-only command ran, and its output is attached |

Both counts are reported. **They are never added together.** A pack that is
2 verified and 8 declared says exactly that. A command that ran and failed
counts as neither — it is shown as a failed check, and the verified count does
not move.

If you want a single number for a slide, this is the wrong tool. That is
deliberate.

## What makes a pack fail

`check` exits non-zero when the pack is not defensible:

- a control claimed **met** with no evidence recorded
- a control claimed **met** while one of its prerequisites is not met — the most
  common way one of these packs is quietly wrong. Tool authorisation cannot be
  met if the agent has no identity of its own to authorise.

An honest `unknown` does **not** fail. Unknown is the correct starting state and
a tool that punishes it teaches people to guess.

## The ten controls

Wave 1 has no prerequisites and can start today. Wave 2 depends on wave 1.

**Wave 1** — own workload identity · declared autonomy level per action class ·
full replayable trajectory · retrieved and tool-returned content treated as
untrusted

**Wave 2** — tool authorisation enforced outside the model · named human
approval for consequential actions · bounded blast radius and a tested kill
switch · irreversible actions staged or delayed · provenance across agents ·
cost per resolved task

## Config

```json
{
  "agent": "support-triage",
  "environment": "production",
  "assessor": "you@example.com",
  "controls": {
    "agent-identity": {
      "status": "met",
      "evidence": "s3://audit/iam-export-2026-08.json",
      "note": ""
    }
  }
}
```

`status` is one of `met`, `not-met`, `not-applicable`, `unknown`.
`evidence` should point at the artefact, not describe it.

## Output

- `--json pack.json` — the machine-readable evidence pack
- `--md report.md` — a Markdown report with command output attached inline
- `--run` — actually execute the read-only checks (off by default; nothing runs
  against your infrastructure unless you ask)

None of this is a compliance assessment. It is a way to start from something
concrete instead of a blank page.
